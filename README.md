MatFile-Parsing-Win

Built with CMake on Windows, Make for Linux

Credit to the original author(s) of mman-win32 for their implementation and to Bruno Haible and Martin Lambers for getpagesize.c, which I modified a bit to work here. Oh, and Courtney I guess.

Note that this is real rough mostly because I haven't written in C before.
